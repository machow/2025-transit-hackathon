# Posit Workweek 2025 Little Tiny Transit Hackathon

The Tiny Transit Hackathon is a 3 hour event focused on learning about public transit,
and exploring open source transit data. It will take place on Tues, Feb 4th of Posit's
annual company work week. Any Posit folks there (in-person or virtually) are welcome to join!

## Public transit data and standards

* **GTFS schedules**: represent transit schedules, fares, stop locations, and transfer options.
* **GTFS realtime (RT)**: represent realtime vehicle location and trip updates.
* **TIDES**: (work in progress) represent vehicle location, passenger count, and fare transaction data.

## Example reports and dashboards

* [cal-itp monthly GTFS quailty report](https://reports.calitp.org/gtfs_schedule/2024/01/208/)
* [gtfs-to-html](https://github.com/BlinkTagInc/gtfs-to-html)
* [datatools-ui](https://github.com/ibi-group/datatools-ui)
* [transitland map](https://www.transit.land/map)

* [python: gtfs-kit](https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit)
* [R: tidytransit](https://github.com/r-transit/tidytransit)


## Potential projects: What could you work on?

* GTFS route timetables and trip map.
* Methods for connecting realtime data to stops.
* Metro Transit travel time and passenger count dashboard.
